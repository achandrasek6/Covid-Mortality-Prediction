"""
Script: Ref_Seq_Import.py

Description:
    This script uses Biopythonâ€™s Entrez utilities to download the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
    (accession NC_045512.2) from NCBI. It performs two main tasks:
      1. Parses the GenBank record to extract gene annotations (gene name, start, end, strand)
         and writes them to a tab-delimited text file.
      2. Writes the full nucleotide sequence for NC_045512.2 to a FASTA file.

Usage:
    Ensure Biopython is installed (`pip install biopython`), then run:
        python Ref_Seq_Import.py

Outputs:
    - NC_045512.2_gene_annotations.txt : Tab-delimited list of gene names with coordinates and strand
    - NC_045512.2_sequence.fasta      : FASTA file of the complete reference genome sequence

Dependencies:
    - Python 3
    - Biopython (Bio.Entrez, Bio.SeqIO)
