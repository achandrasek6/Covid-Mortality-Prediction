"""
Script: report_sample_differences.py

Description:
    This script reads a binary feature matrix CSV (e.g., feature_matrix_train.csv)
    and, for each sample, identifies which features (columns) have a value of 1.
    It then prints each sampleâ€™s ID and variant along with the list of feature labels
    where a difference (value = 1) occurs.

Usage:
    python report_sample_differences.py

Dependencies:
    - Python 3 (no additional libraries required; uses built-in csv module)
