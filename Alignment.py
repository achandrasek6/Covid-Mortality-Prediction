Script: Alignment.py

Description:
    This script prepares and aligns SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences using MAFFT. It:
      1. Reads the reference genome FASTA (NC_045512.2_sequence.fasta) and a set of variant sample FASTAs.
      2. Merges them into a single combined FASTA file with the reference placed first.
      3. Invokes MAFFT (via Biopythonâ€™s wrapper) with the `--auto` option to perform multiple sequence alignment.
      4. Writes the aligned output to a new FASTA file for downstream analysis.

Usage:
    Ensure MAFFT is installed and available in your PATH. Then run:
        python Alignment.py

Outputs:
    - combined.fasta : Unaligned concatenation of reference + variant sequences.
    - aligned.fasta  : MAFFT-generated multiple sequence alignment.

Dependencies:
    - Python 3
    - Biopython (`pip install biopython`)
    - MAFFT (command-line tool)
